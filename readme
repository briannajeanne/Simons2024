# Bioinformatics Data Processing Pipeline

This pipeline processes genetic variant data, performs allele counting, and creates subset files based on sample IDs and genomic positions.

## Files

### `requirements.txt`
- Lists required Python packages
- Main dependency: pandas >= 2.0.0

### `run.py`
Python script that:
1. Merges all TSV files from input directory
2. Fixes sample name (HG10101 â†’ HG00101)
3. Counts major/minor alleles per sample
4. Creates subset files based on sample ID last digit

### `tasks.sh`
Bash script that:
- Takes the subset files from run.py
- Splits each file into 1Mbp chunks between positions 10000000-14999999
- Creates gzipped TSV files named by sample digit and position range

### `check.sh`
Helper script to:
- Count words in output TSV files
- Sort and display results

## Input Data
Located in `exercise_input_data_public/` directory:
- Contains gzipped TSV files with variant info and sample genotypes
- Variant columns: 
  - #CHROM
  - POS
  - ID
  - REF
  - ALT
  - QUAL
  - FILTER
  - INFO
  - FORMAT

## Output
- `allele_counts.tsv`: Contains major/minor allele counts per sample
- `output/*.tsv.gz`: Subset files split by sample ID digit and genomic position
